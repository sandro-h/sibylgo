Text-based TODO application

# Development

## Update version

The main version is updated in version.txt. CI takes care of injecting it into the go binary and vscode extension.

## See vscode extension errors

When packaging, you won't see compile errors, so simply run `npm run compile` to see them.

# TODOS

- Build scripts for local dev (version injection, etc)
